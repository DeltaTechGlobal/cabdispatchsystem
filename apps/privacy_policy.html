<p><strong>Location Data</strong></p>
<p>Our Service collects and uses location information to enable core functionality of the CDS Driver app. Location data is essential for providing taxi dispatch services and is collected in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Foreground Location:</strong> We collect your precise location (GPS coordinates) when the app is actively running on your device. This includes both fine location (GPS) and coarse location (network-based) data.</li>
    <li><strong>Background Location:</strong> We collect your location data even when the app is running in the background or when your device screen is off. This is necessary to continuously track your position for job dispatch purposes.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How We Use Location Data:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Job Dispatch:</strong> Your real-time location is used to match you with nearby taxi jobs. The dispatch system uses your current location to determine which driver is closest to a pickup location and assign jobs accordingly.</li>
    <li><strong>Navigation Services:</strong> Location data is used to provide turn-by-turn navigation directions to pickup addresses, drop-off locations, and office locations.</li>
    <li><strong>Service Optimization:</strong> We use location data to improve our dispatch algorithms and optimize driver-job matching for better service efficiency.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Location Data Collection Details:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Location data is collected continuously while you are logged into the driver app, both when the app is in the foreground and background.</li>
    <li>We use GPS (Global Positioning System) and network-based location services to determine your location.</li>
    <li>Location data is transmitted to our servers in real-time to enable job dispatch functionality.</li>
    <li>Location data may be shared with our service providers (such as Google Maps for navigation) solely for the purpose of providing navigation and mapping services.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Your Control Over Location Data:</strong></p>
<p>You can control location permissions through your device settings. However, please note that:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Location access is required for the app to function properly. If you disable location permissions, you will not be able to receive job assignments or use navigation features.</li>
    <li>You can revoke location permissions at any time through your device's app settings, but this will limit or prevent the app from functioning.</li>
    <li>For Android devices, you may be prompted to grant background location access separately, which is required for continuous job dispatch functionality.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Data Retention:</strong> Location data is retained only as long as necessary to provide our services and may be stored for a reasonable period to support service operations, troubleshooting, and compliance with legal obligations.</p>
<p><strong>Log Data</strong></p>
<p> We want to inform you that whenever you use our Service, in a case of an
    error in the app we collect data and information (through third party products) on your phone
